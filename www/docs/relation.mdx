`@relation` directive allows you to resolve relationships between
entities. Similar to `@field` directive, it writes a resolver for you
so you do not have to write a resolver yourself. It assumes that
relationships are defined as standard `Entity` relationships. The
`name` argument allows you to specify the type of the relationship. It
will automatically look up the entity in the catalog.

1. To define a `User` that is the `owner` of a `Component`:

```graphql
type Component {
  owner: User @relation(name: "ownedBy")
}
```

2. The GraphQL server has baked in support for [Relay][relay]. By
   default, collections defined by a `@relation` directive are modeled as
   arrays. However, if the relationship is large, and should be
   paginated, you can specify it with `Connection` as the field type and
   use the `nodeType` argument to specify what the target of the
   collection should be.

```graphql
type Repository {
  contributors: Connection @relation(name: "contributedBy", nodeType: "User")

  # Or you can just use an array of entities
  contributors: [User] @relation(name: "contributedBy")
}
```

3. If you have different kinds of relationships with the same type you
   can filter them by `kind` argument:

```graphql
type System {
  components: Connection
    @relation(name: "hasPart", nodeType: "Component", kind: "component")
  resources: Connection
    @relation(name: "hasPart", nodeType: "Resource", kind: "resource")
}
```
