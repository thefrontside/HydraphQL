The `@resolve` directive is similar to the `@field` directive, but instead of
resolving a field from the source data, it resolves a field from a 3rd party
API. This is useful when you want to add fields to your schema that are not
available in the source data, but are available from another API.

1. To achieve that first of all you need to create a DataLoader with `createLoader` function

```ts
import querystring from "querystring";
import { createLoader, NodeQuery } from "@frontside/hydraphql";

export const loader = createLoader({
  async ExampleCom(queries: NodeQuery[]) {
    return Promise.all(
      queries.map(async ({ ref, args }) => {
        const response = await fetch(
          `https://example.com/api/${ref}?${querystring.stringify(args)}`,
        );
        return response.json();
      }),
    );
  },
});
```

2. Then you can use the `@resolve` directive with specifying the loader name of your API:

```graphql
type Project {
  tasks: [Task!] @resolve(at: "spec.projectId", from: "ExampleCom")
}
```
