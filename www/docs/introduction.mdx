## GraphQL basics

GraphQL is a powerfull query language and runtime for APIs. It provides a flexible
and efficient approach to requesting and manipulating data from servers. With GraphQL,
clients can specify the exact data they need, and the server responds with
a JSON payload that matches the requested structure. It allows clients to retrieve
multiple resources in a single request, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

The GraphQL schema defines a collection of types and the relationships between them.
The syntax of the schema language is very intuitive and readable. It makes it easy
to understand the capabilities of the API.

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

On the other hand simplicity causes some downsides:

- The schema doesn't describe how the data should be processed to fit the schema.
  It only describes the data structure. Which means that the developer has to write
  imperative code to resolve types and fields from the data.
- The schema language requires a lot of boilerplate code to be written.

```graphql
interface Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]
  appearsIn: [Episode]!
}

type Human implements Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]
  appearsIn: [Episode]!
  starships: [Starship]
  totalCredits: Int
}

type Droid implements Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]
  appearsIn: [Episode]!
  primaryFunction: String
}
```

To solve these problems, HydraphQL was created.

## What is HydraphQL?

HydraphQL is a set of GraphQL directives that allow you to enchance your schema,
declaratively define how the data should be processed and reduce the amount of
boilerplate code.

```graphql
interface Character @discriminates(with: "type") {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @field
  friends: [Character] @resolve
  appearsIn: [Episode]! @resolve(at: "appears_in")
}

type Human @implements(interface: "Character") {
  starships: [Starship] @resolve
  totalCredits: Int @field(at: "total_credits")
}

type Droid @implements(interface: "Character") {
  primaryFunction: String @field(at: "primary_function")
}
```

HydraphQL transforms directives to raw GraphQL schema and adds a set of resolvers.
