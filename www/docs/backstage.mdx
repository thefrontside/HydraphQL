## Backend Development

The Backstage GraphQL plugin is designed for schema-first development of the GraphQL API. It reduces work necessary to expand the schema using schema directives. [Schema directives](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/tools/docs/schema-directives) are extensions to GraphQL schema used to automate implementation of the GraphQL API. In Backstage GraphQL Plugin, schema directives are used to automatically create resolvers. [Resolvers](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/) tell a GraphQL API how to provide data for a specific schema type or field. The Backstage GraphQL Plugin uses what it knows about the Backstage catalog to reduce the need for writing resolvers that call the catalog.
